<!-- ## Hello! -->

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg"> -->

<!-- I'm an [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) PhD student at Cornell University working in natural language processing. My advisor is [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

I have a master's degree in computational linguistics from the University of Washington, where I was advised by [Fei Xia](http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/), and I've worked at organizations like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/empowermd/), [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnl.gov/) (PNNL), and [Maana](https://www.maana.io/), a data analytics startup. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests

My research is in natural language processing and machine learning. I'm interested in unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques, such as word embeddings and topic modeling. I study how these techniques can be used to explore new datasets, ranging from social media to literature to medical data. I'm especially interested in questions about narrative and semantic similarity.
