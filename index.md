<!-- ## Hello! -->

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg"> -->

<!-- I'm an [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) PhD student at Cornell University working in natural language processing. My advisor is [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

## Thinking of the Title



* Why Computational? The visualization is strictly based upon a statistical algorithm as opposed to a creative visualization.
* Why Essays? The underlying algorithms are theorized with design sensibilities as opposed to brute-force and indifferent computing.
<!-- * Interests: NLP, ML, unsupervised methods, digital humanities, computational social science -->

<br>

## All Visualizations across the domains,

* Have an associated Dataset,
* Have an underlying Algorithm,
* Serve a specific purpose

<br>

## Across the domains,
* Music
** Music Genre Dataset,
** Probabilitic Topic Model,
** Music Exploration
